This seminar summarizes the JGR-Oceans paper "The impact of an Antarctic Circumpolar Current meander on air-sea interaction and water subduction" by Vilela-Silva, F., et al. (2024) and the manuscript submitted to JPO "On Air-Sea Heat Flux and Subduction in an Eddying Southern Ocean".

I also gave a similar version of this seminar in Portuguese at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Sao Paulo. The version of this seminar in Portuguese is also [in YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/ajrHWgSDS1Q?si=7n7tBOWdSoGBQvIP).
