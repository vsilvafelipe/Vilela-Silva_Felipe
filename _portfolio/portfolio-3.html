About a decade ago, I never considered the existence of neither eddies nor meanders in the ocean, which now excite me a lot. So, it cheered me up when Helen suggested for me to move my research topic from the deep limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, where the DWBC is located, to another branch of the Meridional Overturning Circulation which the ACC is part of. 
    
During my PhD, I had the opportunity to learn from Prof. Phillips, Prof. Nathan Bindoff (AAPP), Dr. Stephen Rintoul (CSIRO), and Prof. Maxim Nikurashin (UTas) how to diagnose the impact of a meander south of Australia on air-sea interaction and water subduction. We recently submitted this work to JGR: Oceans (Vilela-Silva et al., in review) that we show that the crests of ACC meanders lose heat to the atmosphere and have relatively deep mixed layer than the troughs. We also show that the coupling of the vertical velocities at the base of the mixed layer with the lateral induction of fluid due to the horizontal gradients of the mixed layer depth in ACC meanders lead to localized subduction of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) at the exit of Polar Front meanders' crests (Vilela-Silva et al., in review). The AAIW subduction is one relevant piece of the climate puzzle. 

The diagnostics above are relevant for discussions about the locations of carbon removal from the atmosphere to the ocean at subduction regions. In parallel to the localized subduction analysis in a standing meander, we also explored the water subduction in an eddying Southern Ocean. The current review papers in the subject indicate that the studies about subduction in the Southern Ocean estimated the eddy-induced subduction using eddy diffusivity coefficients to parameterize the effect of eddies in coarse-resolution observational products. The same review papers present that the subduction studies with high-resolution models applied spatial filters in the subduction terms to distinguish the large- and small-scale subduction signal. In our work, we compute the eddy-induced subduction following the definition \textit{per se} without any parameterization or spatial filter in a high-resolution ocean-sea ice model. The preliminary results indicate that the fine-scale signal of mode and intermediate water subduction is mainly driven by steep changes in the seafloor topography (Vilela-Silva et al., in preparation to JPO).

In addition to the abilities above, I also have the tools to implement Empirical Orthogonal Functions and evaluate the dominant modes of oscillation in further studies about ``isolated'' or ``coupled'' variabilities. I implemented this method both for (i) the DWBC off Northeast Brazil where Ilson and I detailed the dominant frequencies related to the passage of the southward propagating DWBC eddies and (ii) the AAC fronts south of Australia where Nathan, Helen, and I observed the dominant and distinguished impacts of the Macquarie Meander's crest and trough individually. I organized the Python code for these studies in the \href{https://github.com/OceanLabPy/OceanLab}{OceanLab} project available in GitHub.

Finally, the PhD also offered me the training from Prof. Phillips, Dr. Benoit Legresy (CSIRO), and Dr. Kurt Polzin (WHOI) to observe the Southern Ocean in Dec/2022 with submesoscale observations at the Macquarie Meander region under SWOT voyage. Additionally, receiving the ``Best Student Inquisitor'' award at the \href{https://cosima.org.au/index.php/meetings/cosima2022/}{COSIMA VI workshop} showed me the importance of asking appropriate questions for each topic. Overall, the researches with Ilson, Helen, Nathan, Steve, and Max enlightened my understanding of the link between the physical oceanography and the climate system.
