The brief period of 6 months (Mar/2020 to Sep/2020) working as an Environmental Analyst under AMBILEV's contract at the Brazilian Petroleum Corporation (Petrobras) convinced me that working as a researcher is what I want to do for a living. On the one hand, the industry experience was great to learn new techniques to organize and report the large datasets of meteoceanographic observations from the oil platforms in Santos and Campos Basins, BR. Moreover, the constant preparation for the numerous meetings per week and writing of the reports to the environmental agencies provided me a singular experience to work in a corporate system. On the other hand, I realized that I would need to get back to academia in order to have a better chance to give a more significant contribution to the Earth, climate, and ocean system.
