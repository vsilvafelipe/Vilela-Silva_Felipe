This lecture contains the derivations and steps to estimate Water Mass Subduction in an Eddying Ocean (Sections 2 and 3 in Marshall, 1997). I also prepared a general introduction to subduction based on Stommel (1979) and Cushman-Roisin (1987) before exploring the eddy-induced subduction (see my notes [here](https://vsilvafelipe.github.io/files/1Notes_Subduction_FelipeVilelaSilva_Jul24.pdf).
