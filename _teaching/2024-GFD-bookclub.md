This lecture contains the derivations and steps to estimate Water Mass Subduction in an Eddying Ocean (Sections 2 and 3 in Marshall, 1997). I also prepared a general introduction to subduction based on Stommel (1979) and Cushman-Roisin (1987) before going into the eddy-induced subduction (see my notes in the pdf).
