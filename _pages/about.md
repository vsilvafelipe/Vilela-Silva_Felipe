Felipe is a researcher, rider, and rock climber (not much, but he wants to climb more). 
His current research interests are  (i) mechanisms of variability of the Ocean Conveyor Belt (ii) heat fluxes and momentum exchange between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the atmosphere, (iii) water subduction in the Southern Ocean, and (iv) eddy genesis along the Deep Western Boundary Current in the South Atlantic.

At the moment, Felipe works as a postdoctoral researcher at the _Institut Fran√ßais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer_ (IFREMER). He is also a University Associate at the University of Tasmania (UTas).

Felipe did his PhD in Quantitative Marine Science at the joint program between the UTas and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. Felipe was also affiliated to the Centre for Climate Extremes (ARC Clex) and Australian Antarctic Program Partnership (AAPP). Previously, Felipe did a honours research for Physical Oceanography at the University of Sao Paulo (USP), BR and University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMassD), USA. Felipe also worked as an Environmental Analyst at AMBILEV/PETROBRAS, Environmental Educator at UGGI, and English teacher in Brazil.
