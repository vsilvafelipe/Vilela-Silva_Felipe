Felipe is a researcher, rider, and rock climber (not much, but he wants to climb more). 
His research interests are (i) heat fluxes and momentum exchange between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the atmosphere, (ii) water subduction in the Southern Ocean, and (iii) eddy genesis along the Deep Wester Boundary Current in the South Atlantic.

At the moment, he is a PhD candidate for Quantitative Marine Science at the joint program between the University of Tasmania (UTas) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. Felipe is also affiliated to Centre for Climate Extremes (ARC Clex) and Australian Antarctic Program Partnership (AAPP). 

Previously, Felipe did a honours research for physical oceanography at the University of Sao Paulo (USP), BR and University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMassD), USA. Felipe also worked as an Environmental Analyst at AMBILEV/PETROBRAS, Environmental Educator at UGGI, and English teacher in Brazil.
